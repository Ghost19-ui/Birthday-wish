      It’s your birthday, and I just wanted to tell you how incredibly special you are to me.  
      Thinking about what you mean to my life, it’s honestly hard to put into words.  
      You're not just a friend; you're truly a blessing who’s always there to light up the path.  

      <br><br>
      Your stunning smile has this magical way of brightening even the gloomiest of days,  
      and your positive attitude is simply contagious.  

      <br><br>
      I'm so profoundly grateful for you, Kalpna.  
      You've stood by me at my absolute lowest, when I felt like I had nothing, and you never once wavered.  
      You've helped me grow into the person I am today by teaching me so much and believing in me  
      even when I forgot to believe in myself.  

      <br><br>
      Thank you for making my life a little paradise and for staying with me through everything.  

      <br><br>
      You're not just a friend; you're family. ❤️
